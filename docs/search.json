Building Population Growth Models in Vensim PLE","text":"initial lab exercise, introduce modeling software program Vensim PLE. starting exercise, download install free version Vensim PLE may access program via machines SCTR A262 computer lab. IMPORTANT NOTE: instructions written version 9.3.5 VensimPLE, version download personal machine. computers A262 use slightly older version program icons menu item names differ somewhat. help, try Vensim Quick Reference Guide. try Vensim User Guide, available via Help menu. Vensim PLE modeling application allows construction variety modeling paradigms capability graphical output. machine choice (computer lab machine), open Vensim PLE application. program starts , see window looks like image , without blank space instead model middle! may want download open image can zoom read labels – pink labels ones want pay attention . whole window Workbench, white space middle construct models, ’s Build Window.   top standard Menu Bar, File, Edit, etc menus. first horizontal bar icons Main Toolbar, icon links things like saving, cutting pasting, etc. second horizontal bar icons contains Sketch Tools, important creating models. lefthand vertical bar icons Analysis Tools, used things like making graphs. bottom, Navigation Appearance Tools. get started, ’ll build simple familiar models population growth (also form basis later models): exponential growth model logistic growth model. models describe/predict size population (number individuals) change time, function variables like growth rate. development population growth models motivated observation population size change natural populations—repeatable ways. , set experimental population organisms, renewable food source, observe population size changes (increases) similar ways replicate populations (e.g., quickly population size increases, point stabilizes). led biologists fit function lines, interpret terms ecological processes (like births deaths). Thus, nothing special equations use , chosen fit observed data reasonably well. models, assume individuals added population result births removed population result deaths. ignore immigration emigration today’s models. Since know want portray (growth population starting number, result births allowing deaths), need think variables model happen variables time. Population size number individuals population. ’s variable want recalculate generation, accounting births deaths record output. Usually, ’re going expect change time. ’ll need set starting value check, every generation, see changed. Birth rate many organisms born organism already present population time step (per capita birth rate). variable can increase population size. value 1.0 means every individual population gives birth one new individual every generation. Note ’ll imagine models counting females organism able clone . Death rate variable can decrease population size (due natural mortality individuals). fraction population dies generation. , value 0.5 means half population willl die generation. Note logically variable must value 0 1. Flow equation calculating change population size time step. take information population size, birth rate, death rate, determine many individuals population next time step. think anything else important regulating population size, ’ll variables/ components relating factors . first population growth model ’ll create exponential growth model. model resources unlimited resource-based cap many individuals can survive. graphically represent growth model? Well, ’re going use stock--flow model, stocks ‘boxes’ can count stuff us flows contain equations update value stocks based parameters specify (like birth death rate). model, population size stock equation calculating change population size flow. stock flow connected flow can change value stock timestep. actually construct model, let’s look little closer math ’ll thinking create model. consider population organisms, newborn organisms arrive due births organisms depart due deaths. VensimPLE, can represent births flow deaths flow . , can use single bidirectional flow, overall direction flow (increasing decreasing stock’s value) net result birth rate minus death rate (b − d). Thus, growth rate r = b − d, intrinsic rate increase. Note r usually represents maximum rate growth. model size population time based rate birth (b), rate death (d), current value N (population size). Right now, ’re worrying genetics-—assuming everyone genotype—-aren’t tracking different genotypes, just counting number total individuals. , population size time zero, N0, want know population size one time step, N1 (one generation), going use exponential growth equation: dN / dt = rNt two-flows model, remember ’ll separate calculation birth one death two different flows. single flow version, ’ll flow growth contain equation N*(b-d). Let’s get started two flow exponential model. start, find open Vensim PLE program (either look Applications/Programs folder use Search function). program opens, click New Model icon, open Model Settings window. want use following values Model Settings:  Now, anything else, save model! Call twoflow-exponential. make sure save go along just case something crazy happens.  create model, first add components model onto Build Window (big white space). stock population size (called N), flow births, flow deaths, birth rate (b), death rate (d).  add stock component model canvas (represent population size), click Stock icon (S box) second horizontal (top) icon bar. click somewhere white area, Build Window. box pops , type N variable representing population size.  Next ’ll add births flow deaths flow. Click Flow icon (arrow tube) second horizontal menu bar click space left N stock. Now move cursor box representing stock N click box representing N. see arrow appear, pointing toward stock N. Name births. Note cloud left just represents somewhere else, unaccounted model things come. connected anything. arrowhead must connected stock.  Now add deaths flow. may able without clicking Flow icon . Click stock N click second time inch right box. see new flow appear, arrow pointing stock N. Name one deaths.  may guess, flows add things object point toward take things away objects point . value goes deaths subtracted N value births added .  Next, can add rate variables, birth rate death rate. birth rate, click Variable icon (box inside) click Build Window, little births flow. Name variable birth rate. Repeat procedure death rate, placing deaths flow. finished, click Move icon avoid adding variables Build Window.  Finally, can add arrows telling Vensim variables can used equations variables. model, means need connect variables flows since equations . Click Arrow icon second horizontal bar, click birth rate, move cursor births flow click births flow. see pink arrow going birth rate births. create arrow N births. Lastly, create arrow death rate deaths N deaths.  Note can change shape arrows dragging circle middle arrow shaft. can also position arrows clicking white space two endpoints, setting arrow. want delete component, click Delete click component want remove.  model now look something like following. Notice stocks boxes, flows hourglass arrow structure variables (rates constants) surrounding shape. components small circle bottom right corner, used moving resizing. Now ’ve created image variables want include, need give values model know related . choose initial population size first time step, pop size determined values two flows. ’ll put equations flows, using existing population size birth death rates (give us many babies per current individual many deaths current individuals). birth death rates can constant values can set vary. ’ll start making constants.  add values equations variables, click Equation icon second horizontal bar (fx inside box). variables model highlighted since none equations yet! Now click one time set correct parameters.  Let’s start population size, N. Click stock N box pop lots options. Equations, see births minus deaths already entered, program assumed based set flows. moment organisms population, need set Initial Value 10. now, ’s ’ll change, everything else fine. Click Ok accept change made close pop .  Next , click birth rate Equations box, type 0.3. Now just Equations box, set Min 0, Max 4 Incr 0.1 (’s increment, much can change time).  death rate, set Equations 0.2, Min 0, Max 1.0, Incr 0.1.  Now set flows. Click births. Equations box, type birth rate * N. can type can click variable names box right . variables connected arrows allowed used. deaths flow, enter equation death rate * N click Ok.  ’s time run model see happens population size start 10 individuals birth rate 0.3 death rate 0.2 (can hopefully guess happen…). run model, click Simulate icon (green play button). small pop quickly appear disappear don’t see results create graph.  create graph, click variable want graph, N. model change time, know x-axis time (years) y-axis variable interest, N. clicking N, click Graph icon left hand icon bar. graph pop showing exponential growth! Now, remember put min, max, increment values birth rate death rate? can use info! Click SyntheSim icon (next Simulate icon). see sliding bars pop birth rate death rate small graphs appear births, N, deaths. graphs show updated results model slide button birth rate death rate. Try , change birth rate 0.1 instead 0.3. finished testing , click SyntheSim exit button (x hexagon). want get larger graph change birth rate death rate, need go back edit equations variables, click Simulate .  looking graphs, pay attention things like long takes reach equilibrium, reached. case exponential model (stabilize), might notice things like long takes population reach size 100. Remember thinking time axis representing generations population.  Graphs often thing want retain show us ’s happening. save graph, go File -> Save. can zoom adjust scale (say select part x-axis) clicking graph. Reset using View menu, Reset Scale. Now, going build model just one difference: instead using flow flow , going use single flow adjusts births deaths time. ’ll still birth rate death rate, ’ll just use equation dN/dt saw , r = b - d. call new flow ‘popgrowth’. build model Build Window though ’ll name variables differently (add 1 variable name). Alternatively, can just open new model, File → New. Save descriptive name, like “singleflowexponential”. Build one without step--step instructions can practice using VensimPLE. Make sure model gives expected output graph! (just like two-flow model.) Next, going build model population growth resources limited renewable — logistic growth model. logistic growth models, assume renewable resources available environment can support many individuals thus rate growth varies depending density population, slowing population approaches carrying capacity. carrying capacity rate growth zero since individuals can supported. equation logistic growth : dN/dt = ΔN = rNt(1 - Nt/K) model includes parameter K, carrying capacity population. model, usually use r represent maximum rate growth don’t separate effects births deaths. can think r(1 − Nt/K) actual rate growth, given population K density. group, go ahead try build model (see image ). Note: use equations exponential growth model building logistic model. However, can use r instead separate values b d. set model, similar parameters exponential model also carrying capacity (K). Let’s use K = 200, r = 0.3, set initial N 10 like earlier. Click Simulation Control first horizontal icon bar. box pop ’ll save changes make. popup box, change run name r0p3 (can’t use decimals run name) Comment box type ‘r = 0.3’, default run don’t change value r. can click r confirm set 0.3. Click Save Changes click Simulate. Now want create new simulation r = 1.0. Click Simulation Control time change run name r1p0 Comments type ‘r = 1.0’. Click variable r change value 1. click Save Changes Simulate. Repeat steps appropriate alterations create simulations r = 2, r = 2.5, r = 2.7. created variations, click Simulate horizontal menu bar, click N, click Graph. graph appear line value r tested. can unclick legend declutter graph figure ’s going .
