<p>Student Hours are times that I have set aside specifically to meet with students. I will be in my office and available – you can sign up for a slot on my gcal or just stop by and give the door a knock! You can drop in by yourself or bring friends; you may have specific questions or just want to say hi – any reason is good enough. If you aren’t available during these intervals, I’m happy to find another time that works – just email me with some times you are available.</p>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#course-description"></a>
</h2>
<p>The evolution of phenotypic traits results from the action of selective and non-selective forces on the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations. We will use mathematical and computational models to study adaptation and the genetic architecture of complex traits in the context of natural populations. These evolutionary approaches have critical applications in the study of disease, conservation biology, agriculture, and the response to climate change. Labs are computer-based and focused on modeling. Prerequisites: BIOL 200 or 210/211. Attributes: 4NS, QFR.</p>

<h2 id="statement-on-accessibility-and-inclusion">Statement on Accessibility and Inclusion<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#statement-on-accessibility-and-inclusion"></a>
</h2>
<p>Central to this course is an understanding and appreciation of how diversity is generated and maintained in nature. In line with that value, I aim to make this course accessible and inclusive of all students. Each individual brings with them a unique set of experiences which inform their perspective when interacting with others and learning new information. All are welcome in this class and expected to put in the work to learn more than you knew coming in. You have the right to ask for assistance, access, or additional resources to meet your learning needs. If you find yourself unable to fully access the course in any way, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your needs. During the first week of classes, we will discuss community norms to guide us in our interactions.</p>
<p><strong>In case of emergency…</strong> Should circumstances arise that prevent you from fulfilling your responsibilities, such as completing exams on time or making it to lab, you should contact me ASAP. If you anticipate issues or conflicts arising in advance, please contact me so that we may make arrangements.</p>

<p>You are expected to adhere to the Oberlin College Honor Code in this course.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Unless otherwise indicated, you may discuss assignments with your classmates but your written work must be your own, with proper citation and credit for sources used (when appropriate).</li>
<li>You should include the honor pledge and your signature on all submitted work. Digital signatures (initials) are acceptable.</li>
</ol>
<p>I am required to report any suspected violations of the Honor Code to the Honor Committee. Independent of any deliberations of the Honor Committee, in this course suspected violations of the Honor Code may result in a non-passing final grade in the course.

<h3 id="use-of-artificial-intelligence-ai">Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#use-of-artificial-intelligence-ai"></a>
</h3>
<p>The Oberlin Honor Code charter specifies that using AI in courses is considered cheating when, “Utilizing artificial intelligence software or other related programs to create or assist with assignments on the behalf of a student unless otherwise specified by the faculty member and/or the Office of Disability &amp; Access.”</p>
<p>Generally, using AI to write any assignments in this course is not appropriate. However, use in helping to write or troubleshoot code can be useful. We will discuss the nuances of this in class, considering the potential benefits, pitfalls, and abuses of AI. Use of AI for coursework is only permitted when expressly allowed by Angie; for any other uses, not specified, seek approval from Angie.</p>

<h2 id="assessment-via-contract-grading">Assessment via Contract Grading<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assessment-via-contract-grading"></a>
</h2>
<p>In this course, we use contract grading, a method of assessment in which you write a contract laying out the work you will complete (to a satisfactory level) in order to earn the grade you desire. I will provide a template contract, requesting you to complete portions of it and you will submit it for my agreement by the end of the first week of class (Fri Feb 6).</p>
<p>Your written contract will describe: * how completed work lines up with expectations for each grade, * due dates for work to be turned in, * the consequences for you if you do not meet the expectations you set.</p>
<p>I choose to use contract grading to provide you agency over your grade and to enable you to focus on learning rather than grades. For details, see the template grade contract. We will also discuss this in class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="assignments">Assignments<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#assignments"></a>
</h2>
<p>All assignments will be turned in electronically, via Google Forms.</p>
<p><strong><em>Participation</em></strong> You are expected to actively participate in this course. This includes doing the assigned readings in advance of class, attending class, asking and answering questions posed during class or discussions, and actively discussing assigned readings during class meetings.</p>
<p><strong><em>Reading Questions</em></strong> They are intended to guide your reading of the text. It’s recommended that you complete them on your own earlier in the week, before attending class. During class meetings, we will frequently discuss the assigned questions. It’s suggested that you turn these in weekly but you will choose the regular due date in your grade contract.</p>
<p><strong><em>Short-answer Exams</em></strong> All exam questions will be take-home, open-note, and open-book (but you may not consult sources that were not specifically used in the class and you may not work with others). Questions are grouped into 4 exams (A, B, C, D), each with suggested due dates. Actual due dates will be specific to your grade contract.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lab Exercises</em></strong> For the first half of the semester (7 lab meetings), you will work in assigned groups to create and then evaluate the assigned model each week. These assignments will also help you to practice the skills you are developing and to explore the use of models to address and study a question. Each individual should write up and turn in their own lab report, suggested to be due within one week of the lab exercise.</p>
<p><strong><em>Modeling Project &amp; Presentation</em></strong> In a group of 2-3 students, you will develop a computational model to address an open problem/question in evolutionary genetics. This will require some initial literature review and your project topic must be approved by me. One objective of this assignment is to improve your comfort and facility with using modeling approaches to gain a general appreciation of the value of this approach. A second objective is practice of research skills and learning how to ask and address research questions to gain a deeper understanding of a subject. The results of your project will be presented to the class, informally, at the end of the semester (May 6, final meeting of the lab).</p>
