<p>
For today’s lab, we will create a model to simulate Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium. Remember that HW Equilibrium means <i><u>no change in
allele frequencies over time</u></i>. Your population can (probably
should) start out of HW proportions but should attain them after one
generation of random mating. This model will be the basis for models we
build in the upcoming weeks. For example, next week we’ll take this
basic HW model and modify it to allow for genetic drift. You may wish to
refer to the textbook or other resources to help you remember the
meanings of equations, etc.
</p>
<p>
Open VensimPLE. It may be helpful to refer to last week’s handout or
your notes to help you remember where things are, etc.

</h2>
<p>
Before starting the model, think about what we are trying to do. What
happens in the HW model? For an example, consider a population of
mussels that reproduce by <a href="https://youtu.be/SZ56PCWpB6o" class="external-link">broadcast spawning</a>: once a year,
individuals release their gametes into the water column, where they meet
up with other gametes at random and undergo syngamy to form a new zygote
(see figure).
</p>
<div class="figure">

The life cycle of the New Zealand green-lipped mussel (<i>Perna
canaliculus</i>, kütai). As larvae, green-lipped mussels are
free-swimming. They metamorphose and settle onto seaweed and
subsequently onto solid surfaces.
</p>
</div>
<p>
In nature, many mussels are iteroparous (spawning more than one
reproductive episode in their lifetimes) but for the sake of our simple
model, we’re going to assume they are semelparous (they reproduce once
and then die) Each individual in the population produces gametes (via
meiosis), spews them out into the water column, and then dies (so we are
modeling them as annuals, discrete non-overlapping generations). The
gametes fuse into diploid zygotes (probabilistically, at random), spend
some time as planktonic larva, and then settle on a hard surface where
they grow into adult mussels. The next year, those adult mussels spew
their gametes into the water and then die, etc (the circle of life…).
</p>
<p>
In our model, the number of Adults represents the total population size
(<i>N</i>). It’s the life stage that we are tracking from one generation
to the next. We’re also going to model the simplest base case, one locus
with two alleles. We will have three genotypes, which is like having 3
different kinds of Adult mussels, each represented by a separate stock
box. The mussels with each genotype will produce gametes (every
individual produces the same number of gametes, no selection!). Those
gametes will be joined at random (following binomial probabilities) to
form the next generation of adults. For each generation, we will want to
examine the observed genotype frequencies (based on the stocks), the
allele frequencies (calculated from observed geno frequencies), and the
HW expected genotype frequencies (calculated from allele frequencies).
</p>
<p>
When we create the new generation of mussels, we will do so following HW
expectations, using the allele frequencies of gametes to determine how
many zygotes of each genotype are formed. Note that we’re going to
assume the population size is not being affected and that it’s large,
we’ll use N = 10000 for the total population in our example. And because
we’re examining HW, which occurs quickly, we’ll use just 10 time steps
(generations).

</h2>
<p>
For your reference, we’re going to create 1 stock for each genotype.
Each stock will have a flow to allow us to add new individuals in the
next generaton. Each stock will also be set up to be Discrete, emptying
out at the end of a time step (b/c all adults die after reproducing). We
will also set up variables to keep track of total population size,
observed genotype frequencies, allele frequencies, and expected genotype
frequencies. Finally, we will want one graph to show geno- type
frequencies and one to show allele frequencies. Below is an image of the
completed model for you to reference.

<p>First, set up your stocks for each genotype. Click the Stock icon
and then click in the Build Window. Name the first one ‘genotypeA1A1’ to
denote that it will keep track of how many individuals have the
genotype. A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub>. Now set up stocks for the other
two genotypes. Like in the image, leave some space around each for you
to add other components.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remember that these boxes will contain a number of individuals of
each genotype, not a frequency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Set up a flow into each stock, which you should name ‘deltaA1A1’,
‘deltaA1A2’, and ‘deltaA2A2’. Delta means change and these flows will
calculate how many new zygotes there are of each genotype, each
generation. Go ahead and make a single flow into each stock. Make sure
the black arrow points into your stock, not away from it.</p></li>
<li><p>To allow us to easily change the size of our population and
figure out how many of each individual to start with, we’ll create a
Variable called ‘inital N’. Click the Variable icon and then click in
the Build Window to create this variable, name it ‘initial N’.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Create the rest of the variables in this list. You just need to
place them in the model and name them for now. We’ll finish set up when
we enter equations.</p>
<ul>
<li>initial freq A1A1 – this will set up the starting frequency of the
A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> genotype.</li>
<li>initial freq A1A2 – this will set up the starting frequency of the
A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> genotype.</li>
<li>initial freq A2A2 – this will set up the starting frequency of the
A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub> genotype.</li>
<li>total N – keeps track of population size for us</li>
<li>obs freq A1A1 – the freq of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> in our

<li>obs freq A1A2 – the freq of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> in our

<li>obs freq A2A2 – the freq of A<sub>2</sub>A<sub>2</sub> in our

<li>freqA1 – frequency of the A1 allele in our population.</li>
<li>freqA2 – frequency of the A2 allele in our population.</li>
<li>exp freq A1A1 – the frequency of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>1</sub> that we
expect from HW given the allele frequencies.</li>
<li>exp freq A1A2 – the frequency of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub> that we

<p><br> 10. Next up, the ‘total N’ variable! You should be able to guess
what the equation for this one will be… we want to know how many
individuals of all genotypes are present so what should we add up?
Discuss with your partner and enter your equation into the box for
‘total N’. Click OK to save and close the popup box.</p>
<ol start="11" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Having set up ‘total N’ and the initial variables, we can enter the
initial values for the genotypes. We already entered a value for the
frequency of each genotype so to get how many individuals of each are
present, we just need to multiply the initial frequency by the total N
value.
<ul>
<li>Click on ‘genotypeA1A1’. What should you enter for the initial
value?</li>
<li>Make sure you do NOT change the equation entry for the genotypes,
that is already set up correctly to be the value of the flow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Now that we have the genotypes set up, we can put in the equations
for each observed genotype frequency (obs freq A1A1, obs freq A1A2, obs
freq A2A2). If we know how many individuals there are in the population
and we know how many there are of genotype A1A1, what is the equation to
get the observed genotype frequency?
<ul>
<li>Example: obs freq A1A1 equation = genotypeA1A1 / total N</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And the observed genotype frequencies are used to get the freqA1 and
freqA2, the allele frequencies! We can just sum up genotype frequencies.
For A1, all of the A1A1 individuals and half of the A1A2 individuals
carry A1 alleles so we get:
<ul>
<li>freqA1 = obs freq A1A1 + 0.5 * obs freq A1A2</li>
<li>Go ahead and set the equation for freqA2 too!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once we have the allele frequencies, we can figure out how many of
each genotype we PREDICT from Hardy-Weinberg (compared to what was
observed). So we can set up our expected genotype frequencies (exp freq
A1A1, exp freq A1A2, exp freq A2A2). For these, we should use the HW
model to predict the expected genotype frequencies so what equations do
we use?
<ul>
<li>Example: exp freq A1A1 equation = p * p = freqA1 * freqA1</li>
<li>Set up the equations for A1A2 and A2A2 as well.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, we are ready to put in equations for the delta values
(deltaA1A1, deltaA1A2, deltaA2A2). These are our expectations given the
allele frequencies and assuming Hardy-Weinberg conditions, but we also
want to convert them into numbers not just frequencies AND we need to
subtract the current value of that genotype stock so that we are just
getting the change, not adding this value on top of the other one.
<ul>
<li>Example: deltaA1A1 = (freqA1 * freqA1 * total N) - genotypeA1A1</li>
<li>Go ahead and put in the equations for the other delta
variables.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once you have finished entering equations, check to make sure they
are correct (you may want to use the key at the end). Save your model
and then click Simulate to run the model. It’s ok to overwrite the
current version. After simulation, to get a graph, hold down Shift while
you click on the things you want to show on one graph (in this case, the
3 observed genotype frequencies) and then click Graph.
<ul>
<li>What happened? Does anything change on the graphs? What did you
expect to see? Consider your responses as you write up the lab exercise
in the next section.</li>

<p>To check our understanding of the HW model and what’s going on, we
should run the model under some different conditions and then evaluate
what happens. Run the following scenarios of starting conditions and
answer the questions below. Look at Lab 1 for instructions about using
Simulation Control to test multiple conditions. NOTE: On the lab
computers Simulation Control is called Sim Setup, to the left of where
it says Run.</p>
<p>As a reminder, when you click on Simulation Control or Sim Setup,
that will let you name a new run (representing a different set of
starting conditions). Then you click on the variable values that you
want to change, adjust them and then click Save Changes and Simulate.
Those simulation outputs will then be saved with the name of the run so
you can more easily refer back to them or graph their outputs.</p>

<li>Which of the trials maintained Hardy-Weinberg equilbrium over time?
How do you know?</li>
<li>Did you expect the model to behave the way it did? Explain.</li>
<li>A younger friend of yours tells you that a population is only in
Hardy-Weinberg when p = 0.5 and q = 0.5. How do you respond?</li>
<li>How did today’s model building go for you? Was there anything of
particular interest or frustration?</li>
