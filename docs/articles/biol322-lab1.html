<p>For this initial lab exercise, we will introduce the modeling
software program Vensim PLE. Before starting this exercise, download and
install the free version of <a href="https://vensim.com/free-downloads/" class="external-link">Vensim PLE</a> OR you may
access the program via the machines in the SCTR A262 computer lab.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE: These instructions are written for version 9.3.5 of
VensimPLE, the version you would download to a personal machine. The
computers in A262 use a slightly older version of the program and the
icons and menu item names differ somewhat. For help, try this <a href="articles/sheets/sci_articles/VenPLE-QuickReference.pdf">Vensim
Quick Reference Guide</a>. Or try the Vensim User Guide, available via
the Help menu.</p>
<p>Vensim PLE is a modeling application that allows the construction of
a variety of modeling paradigms and the capability of graphical output.
On the machine of your choice (your own or the computer lab machine),
open the Vensim PLE application. When the program starts up, you should
see a window that looks like the image below, without blank space
instead of the model in the middle! You may want to download and open
this image so you can zoom in to read the labels – the pink labels are
the ones we want to pay attention to. The whole window is the Workbench,
with the white space in the middle being where we will construct our
models, that’s the Build Window.</p>

<h2 id="learning-to-build-a-basic-population-growth-model">Learning to Build a Basic Population Growth Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#learning-to-build-a-basic-population-growth-model"></a>
</h2>
<p>To get started, we’ll build a few simple and familiar models of
population growth (which will also form the basis of our later models):
the exponential growth model and the logistic growth model. Both of
these models describe/predict how the size of a population (number of
individuals) will change over time, as a function of other variables
like growth rate.</p>
<p>The development of population growth models is motivated by the
observation that population size does change in natural populations—in
repeatable ways. That is, if you set up an experimental population of
organisms, with a renewable food source, you will observe that
population size changes (increases) in similar ways in replicate
populations (e.g., how quickly population size increases, at what point
it stabilizes). This led biologists to fit a function to those lines,
which we could then interpret in terms of ecological processes (like
births and deaths).</p>
<p><b>Thus, there is nothing special about the equations that we use
here, they were chosen because they fit the observed data reasonably
well.</b></p>
<p>In both models, we assume that individuals are added to the
population as a result of births and removed from the population as a
result of deaths. We will ignore immigration and emigration for today’s
models.</p>
<p>Since we know what we want to portray (growth of a population from
some starting number, as a result of births and allowing for deaths), we
need to think about what variables should be in our model and what
should happen to those variables over time.</p>
<ul style="font-weight:normal;" role="list">
<li>
<b>Population size</b> is the number of individuals in the population.
It’s the variable we want to recalculate each generation, accounting for
births and deaths and record as an output. Usually, we’re going to
expect it to change over time. We’ll need to set a starting value and
then check, every generation, to see how it has changed.
</li>
<br><li>
<b>Birth rate</b> is how many organisms are born to each organism
already present in the population each time step (per capita birth
rate). This is the variable that can increase population size. A value
of 1.0 means that every individual in your population gives birth to one
new individual every generation. Note that we’ll imagine for these
models that we are counting only females or that our organism is able to
clone itself.
</li>
<br><li>
<b>Death rate</b> is the variable that can decrease population size (due
to natural mortality of individuals). This will be the fraction of the
population that dies each generation. So, a value of 0.5 means that half
of your population willl die in each generation. Note that logically
this variable must have a value between 0 and 1.
</li>
<br><li>
<b>Flow equation calculating how to change population size each time
step.</b> This is how we will take the information on population size,
birth rate, and death rate, to determine how many individuals are in our
population in the next time step.
</li>
<br><li>
If we think anything else is important in regulating population size,
we’ll have variables/ components relating to those factors too.
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="exponential-population-growth-model">Exponential Population Growth Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#exponential-population-growth-model"></a>
</h2>
<p>The first population growth model we’ll create is the exponential
growth model. This is a model in which resources are unlimited so there
is no resource-based cap to how many individuals can survive.</p>
<p>How do we graphically represent our growth model? Well, we’re going
to use a stock-and-flow model, where <b>stocks</b> are ‘boxes’ that can
count stuff up for us and <b>flows</b> contain the equations that update
the value of the stocks based on other parameters that we specify (like
birth or death rate). So in our model, <u>population size will be a
stock and the equation calculating change in population size will be a
flow</u>. The stock and flow will be connected so that the flow can
change the value of the stock each timestep.</p>
<p>Before we actually construct the model, let’s look a little closer at
the math we’ll be thinking about to create this model. If we consider a
population of organisms, newborn organisms arrive due to births and
other organisms depart due to deaths. In VensimPLE, we can represent
births as a flow IN and deaths as a flow OUT. Or, we can use a single
bidirectional flow, where the overall direction of the flow (increasing
or decreasing the stock’s value) is the net result of birth rate minus
death rate <i>(b − d)</i>. Thus, growth rate is <i>r = b − d</i>, the
intrinsic rate of increase. Note that <i>r</i> usually represents the
maximum rate of growth. We will model the size of the population over
time based on the rate of birth (<i>b</i>), the rate of death
(<i>d</i>), and the current value of <i>N</i> (population size). Right
now, we’re not worrying about genetics-—as if we are assuming everyone
is the same genotype—-so we aren’t tracking different genotypes, just
counting the number of total individuals.</p>
<p>So, if we have population size at time zero, N<sub>0</sub>, and we
want to know population size after one time step, N<sub>1</sub> (one
generation), we are going to use the exponential growth equation:
<br><math style="margin:1em"><i>dN / dt = rN<sub>t</sub></i></math></p>
<p>In the two-flows model, remember that we’ll have to separate the
calculation for birth and the one for death into two different flows.
But in the single flow version, we’ll have a flow for growth which will
contain the equation <i>N*(b-d)</i>. Let’s get started on the two flow
exponential model.</p>

</h3>
<ol style="font-weight:normal;" role="list">
<li>
To start, find and open the Vensim PLE program (either look in the
Applications/Programs folder or use the Search function). Once the
program opens, click the New Model icon, which will open up a Model
Settings window. We want to use the following values for Model Settings:
</li>
<br><table class="table">

</tr>
</table>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Now, before we do anything else, save your model! Call it
twoflow-exponential. And make sure to save as you go along just in case
something crazy happens.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
To create our model, we will first add all of the components of the
model onto the Build Window (the big white space). That will be a stock
for population size (called <i>N</i>), a flow for births, a flow for
deaths, a birth rate (<i>b</i>), and a death rate (<i>d</i>).
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
To add a stock component to the model canvas (to represent population
size), click on the Stock icon (S in a box) in the second horizontal
(top) icon bar. Then click somewhere in the white area, the Build
Window. In the box that pops up, type <i>N</i> the variable representing
population size.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Next we’ll add the births flow and the deaths flow. Click on the Flow
icon (arrow in a tube) on the second horizontal menu bar and then click
in the space to the left of your N stock. Now move the cursor over the
box representing the stock N and click on the box representing N. You
should see an arrow appear, pointing toward stock N. Name it births.
Note that the cloud on the left just represents somewhere else,
unaccounted for in the model from which things come. It does not have to
be connected to anything. But the arrowhead must be connected to our
stock.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Now add the deaths flow. You may be able to do this without clicking on
the Flow icon again. Click on the stock N and then click a second time
about an inch to the right of the box. You should see a new flow appear,
the arrow pointing OUT of the stock N. Name this one deaths.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
As you may guess, flows add things into the object they point toward and
take things away from objects they point out of. So the value that goes
into deaths will be subtracted from N while the value in births will be
added to it.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Next, we can add the rate variables, birth rate and death rate. For
birth rate, click on the Variable icon (a box with an A inside) and then
click on the Build Window, a little above the births flow. Name this
variable birth rate. Repeat this procedure for death rate, placing it
above the deaths flow. When you are finished, click on the Move icon to
avoid adding more variables to the Build Window.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Finally, we can add arrows telling Vensim which variables can be used in
equations for other variables. In this model, that means we need to
connect other variables to the flows since those will have the equations
in them. Click on the Arrow icon on the second horizontal bar, then
click on birth rate, move your cursor over the births flow and click on
the births flow. You should see a pink arrow going from birth rate to
births. Do the same to create an arrow from N to births. Lastly, create
an arrow from death rate to deaths and from N to deaths.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Note that you can change the shape of arrows by dragging the circle in
the middle of the arrow shaft. You can also position arrows by clicking
on white space in between the two endpoints, as you are setting up the
arrow. If you want to delete a component, click on Delete and then click
on the component you want to remove.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Your model should now look something like the following. Notice that
stocks are in boxes, flows have this hourglass and arrow structure and
other variables (rates or constants) have no surrounding shape. All
components have a small circle in the bottom right corner, this is used
for moving and resizing.

</li>
<!-- original size 474, 184 -->
<li>
Now we’ve created the image of the variables we want to include, we need
to give them values so the model will know how they are related to each
other. We will choose an initial population size and after the first
time step, the pop size will be determined by the values of the two
flows. We’ll put equations in the flows, using the existing population
size and the birth or death rates (which give us how many babies per
current individual or how many deaths of the current individuals). The
birth and death rates can be constant values or we can set them up to
vary. We’ll start by making them constants.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
To add values or equations to our variables, we click on the Equation
icon on the second horizontal bar (fx inside a box). All of the
variables in our model will be highlighted since none of them have
equations in them yet! Now we will click on them one at a time and set
the correct parameters.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Let’s start with the population size, N. Click on the stock N and a box
will pop up with lots of options. Under Equations, you will see that
births minus deaths is already entered, the program assumed this based
on how we set up the flows. But at the moment there are no organisms in
our population, so we need to set the Initial Value to be 10. For now,
that’s all we’ll change, everything else should be fine. Click Ok to
accept the change you made and close the pop up.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Next up, click on birth rate and in the Equations box, type 0.3. Now
just above the Equations box, set Min to 0, Max to 4 and Incr to 0.1
(that’s increment, how much you can change it by at a time).
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
For death rate, set Equations to 0.2, Min to 0, Max to 1.0, and Incr to
0.1.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Now to set up the flows. Click on births. In the Equations box, type
birth rate * N. You can type it or you can click on the variable names
in the box to the right and below. Only the variables connected by
arrows in are allowed to be used. For the deaths flow, enter the
equation death rate * N and click Ok.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
It’s time to run our model and see what happens to population size if we
start with 10 individuals and then have birth rate of 0.3 and death rate
of 0.2 (you can hopefully guess what will happen…). To run the model,
click on the Simulate icon (a green play button). A small pop up will
quickly appear and disappear but we don’t see the results until we
create a graph.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
<p>To create a graph, click on the variable you want to graph, N.
Because this is a model of change over time, we know that the x-axis
will be time (in years) and the y-axis will be our variable of interest,
N. After clicking on N, then click on the Graph icon on the left hand
icon bar. A graph should pop up showing exponential growth!<br></p>
</li>
<li>
Now, remember how we put in those min, max, and increment values for
birth rate and death rate? Here is where we can use that info! Click on
the SyntheSim icon (next to the Simulate icon). You should see sliding
bars pop up for birth rate and death rate and small graphs appear below
births, N, and deaths. These graphs show the updated results of the
model if you slide the button for birth rate or death rate. Try it out,
change the birth rate to 0.1 instead of 0.3. When you are finished
testing it out, click the SyntheSim exit button (x in a hexagon). If you
want to get a larger graph with a change birth rate or death rate, you
will need to go back in to edit the equations for those variables, then
click Simulate again.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
When looking at graphs, you should pay attention to things like how long
it takes to reach equilibrium, if such is reached. In the case of the
exponential model (which does not stabilize), you might notice things
like how long it takes for the population to reach a size of 100.
Remember we are thinking of the time axis as representing generations in
a population.
</li>
<p><br></p>
<li>
Graphs will often be the thing we want to retain to show us what’s
happening. To save your graph, go to File -&gt; Save. You can zoom in or
out or adjust the scale (say select only part of the x-axis) by clicking
on the graph. Reset using the View menu, Reset Scale.
</li>

</h3>
<ol style="font-weight:normal" role="list">
<li>
Now, you are going to build the same model that you just did with one
difference: instead of using a flow in and a flow out, you are going to
use a single flow that adjusts for both births and deaths at the same
time. We’ll still have the birth rate and death rate, we’ll just use the
equation for dN/dt that we saw above, where <i>r = b - d</i>. You could
call the new flow ‘popgrowth’.
</li>
<br><li>
You could build this model in the same Build Window though you’ll have
to name the variables differently if you do (you could add a 1 to each
variable name). Alternatively, you can just open a new model, File →
New. Save it with a descriptive name, like “singleflowexponential”.
</li>
<br><li>
Build this one without my step-by-step instructions so you can practice
using VensimPLE. Make sure your model gives the expected output in the
graph! (It should be just like your two-flow model.)

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="logistic-growth-model">Logistic Growth Model<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#logistic-growth-model"></a>
</h2>
<p>Next, you are going to build a model of population growth when
resources are limited but renewable — the logistic growth model. In
logistic growth models, we assume that the renewable resources available
in the environment can only support so many individuals and thus the
rate of growth varies depending on the density of the population,
slowing down as the population approaches the carrying capacity. At
carrying capacity the rate of growth will be zero since no more
individuals can be supported. The equation for logistic growth is:
<i>dN/dt = ΔN = rN<sub>t</sub>(1 - N<sub>t</sub>/K)</i></p>
<p>This model includes the parameter <i>K</i>, the carrying capacity of
the population. In this model, we usually use <i>r</i> to represent the
maximum rate of growth and we don’t separate the effects of births and
deaths. You can think of <i>r(1 − N<sub>t</sub>/K)</i> as the actual
rate of growth, given the population K density.</p>
<p>With your group, go ahead and try to build this model (see image
below). Note: Do not use the equations from the exponential growth model
when building the logistic model. However, you can use <i>r</i> instead
of having separate values of <i>b</i> and <i>d</i>.</p>
<p>When you set up the model, you will have similar parameters to your
exponential model but you will also have a carrying capacity (<i>K</i>).
Let’s use K = 200, r = 0.3, and set initial N to 10 like we had
earlier.</p>
<img src="labimg/logistic.png" alt="View of the opening window of Vensim" style="width:276px; height:168px; padding:0em;">
Once you get your model running, let’s explore what happens when you
change the value of <i>r</i>. With K = 200, we’ll try r = 0.3, r = 1.0,
r = 2.0, r = 2.5, r = 2.7. Instead of using SyntheSim like we did
earlier, we’re going to learn another way to test out different
conditions: using Simulation Control.
<ul role="list">
<li>
Click Simulation Control on the first horizontal icon bar. A box will
pop up where we’ll save the changes we make. In the popup box, change
the run name to r0p3 (you can’t use decimals in the run name) and in the
Comment box type ‘r = 0.3’, this will be our default run where we don’t
change the value of r. You can click on r to confirm it is set to 0.3.
Click Save Changes and then click Simulate.
</li>
<br><li>
Now we want to create a new simulation with r = 1.0. Click on Simulation
Control again and this time change the run name to r1p0 and in Comments
type ‘r = 1.0’. Click on the variable r and change the value to 1. Then
click Save Changes and Simulate.
</li>
<br><li>
Repeat those steps with the appropriate alterations to create
simulations for r = 2, r = 2.5, and r = 2.7.
</li>
<br><li>
Once you have created all the variations, click Simulate on the
horizontal menu bar, click on N, and then click Graph. A graph should
appear that has a line for each value of r that you tested. You can
unclick them from the legend to declutter the graph and figure out
what’s going on. Start with just r = 0.3 and then add the higher values
one at a time. What happens? How might we explain what’s going on?
(Think in terms of biology.)

<p>If you want, go ahead and explore more of the features of VensimPLE.
For example, you can use Comments to leave notes for yourself (or me) on
the Build Window. Or maybe to record info that you will need later.</p>

<p>For this lab exercise, you gained some experience using the program
VensimPLE to build simple population growth models. As a write-up please
respond individually, in narrative form, to the following questions:</p>
<ol role="list">
<li>
Imagine a friend asked you what you did in lab today and provide a brief
description.
</li>
<br><li>
Was anything confusing or interesting to you about using VensimPLE and
building the models?
</li>
<br><li>
Describe how population growth differed between the exponential and the
logistic models. What happened when you varied the value of r in the
logistic model? What do you think is going on? <i>Hint: think about what
the large values of r mean.</i>
</li>
</ol>
