### Drop-In Student Hours
Mon, Tue, Thu 2:00-3:30pm, or email for appointment. [Sign up for student hours here.](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ13c4kxrNqqz4TVPsSeRau7eRLLSLV9GoeCHlJX0ZvTNkbfOzvVkFwCi0GKK-kbi9ZRFFpTgg4o)

Student Hours are times that I have set aside specifically to meet with students. I will be in my office and available – you can sign up for a slot on my gcal or just stop by and give the door a knock! You can drop in by yourself or bring friends; you may have specific questions or just want to say hi – any reason is good enough. If you aren't available during these intervals, I'm happy to find another time that works -- just email me with some times you are available. 

## Class Meetings
Regular meetings: MWF 10:00-10:50 am in SCTR A155.

Lab: W 2:30-4:20pm in SCTR A262. This is the computer lab across the hall from Love Lounge.

## Course Description
The evolution of phenotypic traits results from the action of selective and non-selective forces on the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations. We will use mathematical and computational models to study adaptation and the genetic architecture of complex traits in the context of natural populations. These evolutionary approaches have critical applications in the study of disease, conservation biology, agriculture, and the response to climate change. Labs are computer-based and focused on modeling. Prerequisites: BIOL 200 or 210/211. Attributes: 4NS, QFR.

## Course Objectives
Students completing this course will:

* Gain knowledge of and appreciation for topics in evolutionary genetics.
* Learn to develop and evaluate computational evolutionary models.
* Practice reading and understanding scientific literature.
* Improve scientific writing and oral communication skills.
* Gain a deeper understanding of critical thinking as applied to evolutionary genetics.
* Practice carrying out open-ended, investigative research projects.

## Statement on Accessibility and Inclusion

Central to this course is an understanding and appreciation of how diversity is generated and maintained in nature. In line with that value, I aim to make this course accessible and inclusive of all students. Each individual brings with them a unique set of experiences which inform their perspective when interacting with others and learning new information. All are welcome in this class and expected to put in the work to learn more than you knew coming in. You have the right to ask for assistance, access, or additional resources to meet your learning needs. If you find yourself unable to fully access the course in any way, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your needs. During the first week of classes, we will discuss
community norms to guide us in our interactions.

**In case of emergency...** Should circumstances arise that prevent you from fulfilling your responsibilities, such as completing exams on time or making it to lab, you should contact me ASAP. If you anticipate issues or conflicts arising in advance, please contact me so that we may make arrangements.

## Course Materials

<i>Conservation and the Genetics of Populations</i>, 2nd ed. (2013) by FW Allendorf, G Luikhart, and SN Aitken, published by Wiley-Blackwell, is required for this course. It is available in the bookstore or may be ordered online. The College library has access to an electronic version of the text, available [here](http://bl3fb4ht9x.search.serialssolutions.com/?sid=sersol&SS_jc=TC0000722534&title=Conservation%20and%20the%20genetics%20of%20populations). 

I will be providing PDFs of additional reading material, some from textbooks, some primary literature. Below I list several suggested texts that are good references when you need more information about a topic.

All course materials are available via links within this webpage. There is no Bb site for this course.

## Honor Code

You are expected to adhere to the Oberlin College Honor Code in this course.

1. Unless otherwise indicated, you may discuss assignments with your classmates but your written work must be your own, with proper citation and credit for sources used (when appropriate).
2. You should include the honor pledge and your signature on all submitted work. Digital signatures (initials) are acceptable.

I am required to report any suspected violations of the Honor Code to the Honor Committee. Independent of any deliberations of the Honor Committee, in this course suspected violations of the Honor Code may result in a non-passing final grade in the course. More information on the Oberlin Honor Code may be found here: http://new.oberlin.edu/students/policies/honor-system-charter.

### Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The Oberlin Honor Code charter specifies that using AI in courses is considered cheating when, "Utilizing artificial intelligence software or other related programs to create or assist with assignments on the behalf of a student unless otherwise specified by the faculty member and/or the Office of Disability & Access."

Generally, using AI to write any assignments in this course is not appropriate. However, use in helping to write or troubleshoot code can be useful. We will discuss the nuances of this in class, considering the potential benefits, pitfalls, and abuses of AI. Use of AI for coursework is only permitted when expressly allowed by Angie; for any other uses, not specified, seek approval from Angie.

## Resources Offering Support

Angie is available for individual consultation during student hours or by appointment. If you are looking to improve your performance or are struggling in ways new to you but not sure how to proceed, I am happy to discuss and provide suggestions.

## Assessment via Contract Grading

In this course, we use contract grading, a method of assessment in which you write a contract laying out the work you will complete (to a satisfactory level) in order to earn the grade you desire. I will provide a template contract, requesting you to complete portions of it and you will submit it for my agreement by the end of the first week of class (Fri Feb 6).

Your written contract will describe:

* how completed work lines up with expectations for each grade,
* due dates for work to be turned in,
* the consequences for you if you do not meet the expectations you set.

I choose to use contract grading to provide you agency over your grade and to enable you to focus on learning rather than grades. For details, see the template grade contract. We will also discuss this in class.

## Assignments

All assignments will be turned in electronically, via Google Forms.

***Participation*** 
You are expected to actively participate in this course. This includes doing the assigned readings in advance of class, attending class, asking and answering questions posed during class or discussions, and actively discussing assigned readings during class meetings.

***Reading Questions*** 
They are intended to guide your reading of the text. It's recommended that you complete them on your own earlier in the week, before attending class. During class meetings, we will frequently discuss the assigned questions. It's suggested that you turn these in weekly but you will choose the regular due date in your grade contract.

***Short-answer Exams*** 
All exam questions will be take-home, open-note, and open-book (but you may not consult sources that were not specifically used in the class and you may not work with others). Questions are grouped into 4 exams (A, B, C, D), each with suggested due dates. Actual due dates will be specific to your grade contract.

***Lab Exercises*** 
For the first half of the semester (7 lab meetings), you will work in assigned groups to create and then evaluate the assigned model each week. These assignments will also help you to practice the skills you are developing and to explore the use of models to address and study a question. Each individual should write up and turn in their own lab report, suggested to be due within one week of the lab exercise.

***Modeling Project & Presentation*** 
In a group of 2-3 students, you will develop a computational model to address an open problem/question in evolutionary genetics. This will require some initial literature review and your project topic must be approved by me. One objective of this assignment is to improve your comfort and facility with using modeling approaches to gain a general appreciation of the value of this approach. A second objective is practice of research skills and learning how to ask and address research questions to gain a deeper understanding of a subject. The results of your project will be presented to the class, informally, at the end of the semester (May 6, final meeting of the lab).
