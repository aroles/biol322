## Overview {#overview}

Up to this point, we have been working with a single locus. This week, we'll build a model with two loci ($A$ and $B$). This will allow us to investigate **gametic disequilibrium ($D$)**, which is the non-random association of alleles at different loci.

In a two-locus system, we track four possible gametes:
* $G_1$: $A_1B_1$
* $G_2$: $A_1B_2$
* $G_3$: $A_2B_1$
* $G_4$: $A_2B_2$

The frequency of these gametes in the population determines the genotype frequencies and the level of disequilibrium.

## Build the two-locus model {#build}

To build this model, we need to define the initial allele frequencies for both loci, the initial level of disequilibrium, and the recombination rate ($r$).

### Initial Variables

Create the following variables to set up your starting conditions:

| Variable | Description | Equation | Min | Max | Incr |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **pAinit** | initial frequency of allele $A_1$ | 0.5 | 0 | 1 | 0.01 |
| **pBinit** | initial frequency of allele $B_1$ | 0.5 | 0 | 1 | 0.01 |
| **r** | recombination rate | 0.5 | 0 | 0.5 | 0.01 |
| **Dinitial** | initial gametic disequilibrium | 0 | -0.25 | 0.25 | 0.01 |

### Gamete Frequencies and Selection

The model tracks the frequencies of the four gametes over time. Use the following equations for your variables:

| Variable | Equation |
|:---|:---|
| **G1** | `(pAinit * pBinit) + Dinitial` |
| **G2** | `(pAinit * (1 - pBinit)) - Dinitial` |
| **G3** | `((1 - pAinit) * pBinit) - Dinitial` |
| **G4** | `((1 - pAinit) * (1 - pBinit)) + Dinitial` |
| **wbar1** | `G1 * w11 + G2 * w12 + G3 * w13 + G4 * wHet` |
| **wbar2** | `G1 * w12 + G2 * w22 + G3 * wHet + G4 * w24` |
| **wbar3** | `G1 * w13 + G2 * wHet + G3 * w33 + G4 * w34` |
| **wbar4** | `G1 * wHet + G2 * w24 + G3 * w34 + G4 * w44` |
| **wmean** | `G1 * wbar1 + G2 * wbar2 + G3 * wbar3 + G4 * wbar4` |

### Tracking Allele Frequencies and D

Add these variables to monitor the state of the population:

| Variable | Equation |
|:---|:---|
| **freq A1** | `G1 + G2` |
| **freq B1** | `G1 + G3` |
| **D** | `(G1 * G4) - (G2 * G3)` |
| **Dmax** | `IF Dinitial = 0 THEN 0 ELSE MIN(pAinit * (1 - pBinit), (1 - pAinit) * pBinit)` |

## Test your model {#test}

Run a baseline simulation with $r = 0.5$ and $D_{initial} = 0.25$. You should observe $D$ decaying over time toward zero. If your lines are not moving as expected, check your gamete equations and ensure $r$ is connected to the flows.

## Lab Write-Up {#submit}

### Questions

1.  **Decay of $D$ over time.** How does the recombination rate ($r$) influence the speed at which gametic disequilibrium disappears? Run simulations with $r = 0.5$, $r = 0.1$, and $r = 0.01$.

2.  **Selection and $D$.** Can selection create or maintain gametic disequilibrium even when recombination is occurring? Set $r = 0.1$ and apply different fitness values to the double homozygotes.

3.  **Hitchhiking.** Observe what happens to the frequency of allele $B_1$ when it is neutral but the $A$ locus is under strong selection and $D$ is high.

4.  **Reflection.** How does the concept of linkage disequilibrium help us map genes or understand the history of a population?
