When you have completed the exercise below, submit your model and your lab write-up via the [Google Drive Form](https://forms.gle/E3QLACX1aA2Q6ist5). Responses due by the following week's lab period.

During lab, we will work in groups. Here are the groups assigned for today's exercise:

* Bethany and Amanda
* Jordyn and Chloe
* Amy and Paige
* Natalie and Skylar
* Ella and Savannah
* Clara and Arc
* Miles and Emmy

## Overview {#overview}

Up to this point, we have assumed that our populations are mating at random. This week, we will relax that assumption to investigate **Inbreeding**. Inbreeding occurs when individuals are more likely to mate with relatives than expected by chance. 

While there are many forms of inbreeding, we will focus on **selfing** (self-fertilization) as our primary mechanism. We will track how the frequency of heterozygotes ($A_1A_2$) changes relative to homozygotes over time, and how this relates to the inbreeding coefficient ($F$).

## Build the Inbreeding Model {#buildmodel}

To build this model, we will use a single-locus framework but adjust how genotypes are formed each generation based on a specific "selfing rate."

### Initial Variables

Create the following variables to define your starting population and mating system:

| Variable | Description | Equation | Min | Max | Incr |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **self rate** | proportion of population that self-fertilizes | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0.01 |
| **initial freq A1A1** | starting frequency of $A_1A_1$ | 0.25 | 0 | 1 | 0.01 |
| **initial freq A1A2** | starting frequency of $A_1A_2$ | 0.5 | 0 | 1 | 0.01 |
| **initial freq A2A2** | starting frequency of $A_2A_2$ | 0.25 | 0 | 1 | 0.01 |

### Genotype Equations

In a selfing model, the offspring of a heterozygote ($A_1A_2$) are 25% $A_1A_1$, 50% $A_1A_2$, and 25% $A_2A_2$. We must account for this shift in genotype frequencies:

| Genotype | New Frequency Equation |
|:---|:---|
| **A1A1 next** | `(1 - self rate) * (p^2) + self rate * (freqA1A1 + 0.25 * freqA1A2)` |
| **A1A2 next** | `(1 - self rate) * (2 * p * q) + self rate * (0.5 * freqA1A2)` |
| **A2A2 next** | `(1 - self rate) * (q^2) + self rate * (freqA2A2 + 0.25 * freqA1A2)` |

### Tracking Inbreeding ($F$)

Create a variable for the inbreeding coefficient to monitor the deviation from Hardy-Weinberg expectations:

* **F**: `1 - (observed_H / expected_H)`
  * Where `observed_H` is the current frequency of $A_1A_2$.
  * Where `expected_H` is $2pq$.

## Lab Write-Up {#submit}

### Questions

1. **Selfing and Genotype Frequencies.** Run the model with a selfing rate of 0.5 and 1.0. 
    * Does the allele frequency ($p$) change over time?
    * What happens to the frequency of heterozygotes? 
    * What is the equilibrium value of $F$ for each rate?

2. **Test of Equilibrium.** Use the trials in the table below to observe how different starting frequencies impact the speed at which the population reaches its inbreeding equilibrium.

| Trial | self rate | initial freq $A_1A_1$ | initial freq $A_1A_2$ | initial freq $A_2A_2$ | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1a | 0.5 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.25 | 50% selfing, HW start |
| 1b | 0.5 | 0.45 | 0.1 | 0.45 | 50% selfing, low Het start |
| 1c | 0.8 | 0.25 | 0.5 | 0.25 | 80% selfing, HW start |

3. **Population Fragmentation Scenario.**


| Trial | self rate | initial freq $A_1A_1$ | initial freq $A_1A_2$ | initial freq $A_2A_2$ | Description |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 2a | 0.8 | 0.02 | 0.85 | 0.13 | 80% selfing, $p=0.445$ |

**Describe what happened in this run (Trial 2a). This represents an extreme case where a population is fragmented by habitat loss, leading to a sudden increase in inbreeding.**

4. **Reflection.** Summarize the patterns demonstrated in this model. How do these results influence your thinking about the consequences of inbreeding in conservation biology?
